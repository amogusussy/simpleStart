# Setup

To make everything run correctly, you'll need to set the correct ID for the weather.

- Go to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org)
- Search for your town/city
- Copy the last 7 digits in the URL bar
- Replace `YOUR ID HERE` (line 88) in `main.js` with the 7 digit number you just copied

Then, you should be able to run it with no issues. If you encounter any issues, please make an issue/PR on github.
